# IoT and Physics Measurement Technology Group

Welcome to the [Nagasaki Institute of Applied Science] IoT and Physics Measurement Technology Group!

Physics experiments can not be done by only physicists. Collaboration with engineers and other professionals is vital for the successful experiments. We have developed hardware and software for several physics experiments at [CERN] Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.

At LHC, as part of the [ALICE collaboration], we played a key role in the development of the readout system for Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in LHC Run 3. Toward LHC Run 4, we are developing the trigger system for FoCal, the forward calorimeter for [ALICE], with other institutes.

The current contact person is [Ken Oyama](mailto:oyama@nias.ac.jp).
